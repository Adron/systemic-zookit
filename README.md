## Description

A basic tool for using [Zookeeper](https://zookeeper.apache.org/) as configuration for application services development based on convention (as described below).

## Togglez

For this particular library, to gain communication to Zookeeper, I've used [Togglez](https://github.com/adron-orange/togglez).

## Zookeeper Information

This library uses Zookeeper as the core repository of configuration data. To learn more about Zookeeper checkout the following blog entry I've put together on the topic here on "[Researching and Learning Zookeeper: A Guide](http://compositecode.com/2016/02/01/researching-learning-about-zookeeper-a-guide/)"
