## Description

A basic tool for using [Zookeeper](https://zookeeper.apache.org/) as configuration for application services development based on convention (as described below).

## Prerequisites

To run this project or set it up for use or development the following are needed.

* Zookeeper Instance
* .NET 4.5 and/or the latest Mono (testing versions now) More information TBD as testing is done and dependencies on legacy versions of .NET are removed. Ideally this is focused on and will build primarily for Core CLR without regard for legacy versions of .NET.
