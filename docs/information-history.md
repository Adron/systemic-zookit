# Libraries

These are the core libraries or dependendent services that this library is built around. Togglez is used for connectivity to Zookeeper and of course Zookeeper is the distributed configuration storage service.

## Togglez

For this particular library, to gain communication to Zookeeper, I've used [Togglez](https://github.com/adron-orange/togglez).

## Zookeeper Information

This library uses Zookeeper as the core repository of configuration data. To learn more about Zookeeper checkout the following blog entry I've put together on the topic here on "[Researching and Learning Zookeeper: A Guide](http://compositecode.com/2016/02/01/researching-learning-about-zookeeper-a-guide/)"
