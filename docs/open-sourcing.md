# OSSing Zookit & Zoodock

The project(s) I'd currently like to open source include the following two libraries/projects.

1. systemic-zookit
* systemic-zoodock

## Project *systemic-zookit*

This project is setup with an Apache-2.0 License and currently building with Team City and Travis CI. Both builds are working and the project is ready for ongoing development.

### Mission

The mission of this project is to provide an IConfiguration based library for use in standard .NET Applications, and specifically for eventual build and operation with any future Core CLR Platform Development.

### Core Functionality

The project will provide the following functions/method calls from several objects that meets the IConfiguration

## Project *systemic-zoodock*

This project is the DockerFile and respective scripts needed to startup a cluster built of Docker Containers using Ubuntu to run Zookeeper with Exhibitor (Netflix's Zookeeper Web Interface). This cluster can then be used for further development and currently for any test execution of the Zookit library.
